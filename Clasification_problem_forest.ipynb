    "The Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of 0.76, indicating that it correctly classifies 76% of the validation samples. However, the F1 score of 0.82 suggests that, despite moderate overall accuracy, the model performs particularly well in balancing precision and recall, especially for the positive class. This is supported by the confusion matrix which shows that the model correctly identifies most positive samples while only misclassifying 25 of them. The main source of error is the relatively large number of false positives, meaning the model often predicts class 1 when the true label is class 0. Overall, the model is strong at detecting positives but less reliable at rejecting negatives, which explains the higher F1 score compared to accuracy."

    "After incorporating the extra dataset, the model shows a slight improvement in performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.77 and an increased F1 score of 0.84. The updated confusion matrix indicates that the model further reduces false negatives, meaning it becomes even better at correctly identifying positive samples. False positives also decrease slightly, suggesting a modest gain in precision. The clearer separation between classes and the improved F1 score confirm that adding extra data helps the model generalize better, particularly by strengthening its ability to detect positive cases while maintaining balanced performance across both classes"

    "At first glance, the Random Forest with extra data may appear to outperform the neural networks, especially given its high F1 score. However, this F1 score is not macro, meaning it only reflects performance for class 1, which is the easier and best-performing class. This makes the comparison unfair. When both models are compared on equal terms, the overall accuracy is higher for the CNN, showing that the neural network achieves better balanced performance across classes. Additionally, the computational cost of the Random Forest, due to the large number of trees and the random search over hyperparameters, is significantly higher, making it impractical compared with any of the neural network approaches, which train much faster and scale more efficiently."
